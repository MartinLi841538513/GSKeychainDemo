#GSKeychain – a simple Objective-C wrapper around the iOS keychain

This project provides a simple, `NSUserDefaults`-style interface over the 
iOS keychain.

This is currently work in progress.

#Sample usage

```objective-c
// Store a secret
[[GSKeychain systemKeychain] setSecret:@"t0ps3kr1t" forKey:@"myAccessToken"];

// Fetch a secret
NSString *secret = [[GSKeychain systemKeychain] secretForKey:@"myAccessToken"];

// Delete a secret
[[GSKeychain systemKeychain] removeSecretForKey:@"myAccessToken"];

// Delete all secrets
[[GSKeychain systemKeychain] removeAllSecrets];
```

#Adding to your project

##Drag and drop

1. Drag `GSKeychain.h` and `GSKeychain.m` into your project
2. Add Security.framework to **Link Binary With Libraries** in your target settings in Xcode
3. `import "GSKeychain.h"` where appropriate

GSKeychain uses ARC. If your project doesn't use ARC you could enable it for
these files, or use GSArchive as a static library instead.

##As a static library

1. Download the project and build it
2. Drag libGSKeychain.a and GSKeychain.h into your project
3. Add Security.framework to **Link Binary With Libraries** in your target settings in Xcode
4. `import "GSKeychain.h"` where appropriate
